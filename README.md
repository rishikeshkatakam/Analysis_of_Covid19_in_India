# COVID-19 Pandemic Data Analysis in India

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of COVID-19 pandemic data in India using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The analysis is performed using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, and data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing trends and patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains reported COVID-19 numbers in India, including information such as date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, etc. The dataset can be found on Kaggle at [link to dataset](insert_link_here).

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Internet connection to download the dataset (if not already downloaded)

## Instructions
1. Download or clone the project repository from [repository link](insert_link_here).
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file provided (`Analysis_of_Covid19_in_India.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.
4. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and visualize the results.
5. Follow the comments and markdown cells within the notebook for detailed explanations and insights.
